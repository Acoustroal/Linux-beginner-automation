***Compatible with Centos/Debian/Mint/Kali/Ubuntu,I only completed some common functions before, and I will consider and add problems in the later stage***
#### There are two modes of operation
* GUI
>Enter the GUI mode password:PDNB
* CLI
>No password

>Due to limited time and energy, I have not tested all the distributions and different versions, but the distribution I mentioned above is ok. The script is also developed for large user group environment, which can only be said to meet most of the environment.
>If you find any Bug using this script, please send me an email, I will fix it and reply you.
